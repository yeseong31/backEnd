          Black-on-black ware is a 20th- and 21st-century pottery tradition developed by the Puebloan Native American \
          ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. Traditional reduction-fired blackware has been made for centuries by \
          pueblo artists. Black-on-black ware of the past century is produced with a smooth surface, with the designs \
          applied through selective burnishing or the application of refractory slip. Another style involves carving \
          or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations several families from Kha’po \
          Owingeh and P’ohwhóge Owingeh pueblos have been making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down \
           from matriarch potters. Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. \
           Several contemporary artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors.',
